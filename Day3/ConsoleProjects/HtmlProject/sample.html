        <b>  Apply the SerializableAttribute attribute to a type to indicate that instances of the type can be serialized. An exception is thrown if you attempt to serialize but the type doesn't have the SerializableAttribute attribute.</b> <br /><hr />

        <i><mark> To prevent a field from being serialized, apply the NonSerializedAttribute attribute. If a field of a serializable type contains a pointer, a handle, or some other data structure that is specific to a particular environment, and the field cannot be meaningfully reconstituted in a different environment, then you may want to make it nonserializable.<br /></i><hr /></mark>
        <h2>  If a serialized class contains references to objects of other classes that are marked SerializableAttribute, those objects will also be serialized.<br /></h2>
